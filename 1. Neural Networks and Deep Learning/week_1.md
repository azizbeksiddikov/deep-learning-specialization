Name: Introduction to Deep Learning 

Q&A:

1. What is a Neural Network?
- A computational model with layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs through weighted connections and activation functions to learn patterns and make predictions.

2. Structured Data vs Unstructured Data?
- Structured data has fixed format (tables, databases with rows/columns). Unstructured data has no predefined format (images, text, audio, video) and requires more complex processing.

3. Activation functions
3.1. Sigmoid or logistic function

4. RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are good for data with a temporal component?
- RNNs maintain hidden states that carry information from previous time steps, making them suitable for sequential data like time series, NLP, and speech recognition.
